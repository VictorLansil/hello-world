# hello-world
Just anoter repository (something about hello world)

Maybe, just maybe, sometimes the will to say hello to the whole world has come from an empty place hidden in our soul. Born from the fear , the fear of never be notice by anyone. So we try to fill this lack, the empty in our hearts, grabing into in all the atention we could have from a one, a friend, a familiar, a strange, don't matter who, but just somebody. It's something like:
"Hello world, please notice me, i'm here".
